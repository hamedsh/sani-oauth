Requirements
============

* python >= 3.6


Installation
============

Just install via pip:

.. code:: 

    pip install sanic_oauth

Note, that to use blueprint correctly, you need to additionally install :code:`sanic` and :code:`sanic-session`.


Usage
=====

Simple way for use this is blueprint with oauth configuration. 

But, before use it you need to:

1. Create :code:`aiohttp.ClientSession` and bind to app like :code:`async_session` variable.
2. Create session interface from :code:`sanic-session` package and bind it to app like :code:`session_interface` variable.
3. Configure :code:`app.config` settings. You should pass :code:`OAUTH_PROVIDER, OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI, OAUTH_SCOPE` and another settings, for example, :code:`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID, OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Every setting with :code:`OAUTH` prefix will be passed to oauth provider construction.
4. Apply blueprint 
5. Add decorator :code:`login_required` to routes, that required oauth.


You can see example_ for more details.


Advanced usage
==============

If you don't like current blueprint, you always can use providers directly and implements you own logic, like in old_example_.
